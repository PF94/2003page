Sonichu took full advantage of the PLAYSTATION Eye by presenting a detailed

&amp; Rosechu, as not to kill too much space on cwcville.com.&nbsp; Follow
the link below.</font></b>
<br><b><font face="Aerial"><a href="http://sonichu-roschu.blogspot.com/">http://sonichu-roschu.blogspot.com/</a></font></b>
</p><p><b><font face="Aerial">---An Important Update---</font></b>
</p><p><b><font face="Aerial">With the Sonichu Fanbase growing wildly with
lots of energtic Hype, I am ready to take Sonichu and my world of Cwcville
back to <a href="http://www.nintendo.com">Nintendo of America</a> and <a href="http://www.sega.com">SEGA
of America</a>. And upon the unity in business between Nintendo, the company
who provided me with my second gaming system, the Game Boy, after my very
first Commodore 64 computer, SEGA, the company who introduced Sonic the
Hedgehog as not only my Life-Long Hero, after the American Rabbit, but
as the True Role Model Icon I am proud to have learned some of my attitudes
and beliefs from since 1991, and myself, Christian Weston Chandler, we
will make Sonichu and Rosechu and their world being more Real than I was
able to make them by myself with pen and markers in hand, and a vasly-knowledgeable
imagination.</font></b>
</p><p><b><font face="Aerial">You won't be able to truly say you've "Caught
Them All", until you've caught the Original Sonichu and Rosechu in a CWC
Approved Nintendo/Sega Pok'emon Lightning Version on GBA and DS to catch
a great share of the other currently avilable Four Hundred and Ninty-Three
Pok'emon.</font></b>
</p><p><b><font face="Aerial">Think you know the ins and outs of Sonichu and
Rosechu, wait until Season Two of the Comic Book Series, likely to start
within the year 2009. I will withdraw myself from being as intrusive in
the series as I have been so far; I've been selfish, and I'm tired of drawing
myself so much. See how I take my leave of Cwcville in the Season Finale,
to hopefully be uploaded and on the Sonichu Site 4th Quarter, 2008 or 1st
Quarter, 2009.</font></b>
</p><p><b><font face="Aerial">And because I've been hogging the spotlight,
you
don't know Sonichu and Rosechu as you properly should. In the first CWC
Approved Release of the "Sonichu's Adventure" video game, with Nintendo
and SEGA's help, on Nintendo Wii (although it was intended originally for
Gamecube), with compatibility with the Wii Classic Controler as well as
Gamecube Contoller, with rumble functionality hopefully. Sonichu is more
than Lightning and Lightning-Speed, and Rosechu is more than delightful
Bolts and Heart-Felt for Sonichu. Play on, as they rescue each other from
the darkest evil that has manifested itself within some recycled nuts and
bolts on the moon. And what a storyline it will have, based mostly from
the comics with the duo and the Chaotic Combo as well.</font></b>
</p><p><b><font face="Aerial">And I HAVE the idea for the Video Game for myself,
if I can swing that with SEGA as well, an epic tale of my tragic Adult
Life straight from my tortured heart and soul. I will bring the pain to
the Jerkops, I will kick Mary Lee Walsh into her cauldron to burn, as well
as the other villians. And I will have support from my Electric-Hedgehogs,
my mother and father, my Closest Gal-Pals who I've grown to love; Megan
Schroeder and Anna McLerran to name a couple, sparingly in the game. And
I will square-off in the TRULY SELF-EPIC Battle between me, and my Dark
Half. I plan to have THIS GAME ALONE go Multi-Console between Nintendo
Wii, Playstation 2 and Playstation 3 (with downloadable content); screw
the HEX-Box.</font></b>
</p><p><b><font face="Aerial">----And All This CAN come to Fruition... with
YOUR HELP!----</font></b>
</p><p><b><font face="Aerial">The populace of Sonichu, Rosechu and Christian
Chandler fans. All I ask for in minimum, is to contact <a href="http://www.nintendo.com">Nintendo

way of POSTING in their respective FORUMS, sending them E-Mails, and, HIGHLY

and that they should get in touch with me, Christian Weston Chandler, via
