<p>If you want to edit 2003page, You'll need to have a GitHub account and 
outside access to 2003page. Ask Gamerappa on Discord/Escargot if you want to (re)join 
2003page.</p>
<p>Rule 1: For opening the 2003page repository, Do not use the Open Site button, 
as it will generate useless metadata junk that will break the site.</p>
<p>You can join the <a href="https://discord.gg/4RcXmTu">gamerappaCommunity</a> 
Discord server.</p>
