## HOW TO ADD A THING TO THE CLICKOMIZER

Literally every contributor needs this. They dont understand how the fucking thing works and its actually pissing me off

# Step 0:

Submit your file to Upwader, and he'll see if it fits under the GitHub regulations.
`My discord is Upwader#2829 (CASE SENSITIVE)`

# Step 1:

Upload your file to assets/clickomizer

# Step 2:

Go to root/clickomizer.html and copypaste the last string of random urls WITH THE COMMA, then modify it to link to your submission.
`urls[33] = "https://2003page.upwader.com/assets/clickomizer/yunicuaEXE.mp3";`

# Step 3 (REALLY IMPORTANT):

MODIFY THE URL NUMBER. I CANT STRESS THIS ENOUGH
`urls[33] = "https://2003page.upwader.com/assets/clickomizer/yunicuaEXE.mp3";`
`urls[34] = "https://2003page.upwader.com/assets/clickomizer/yunicuaEXE.mp3";`
`urls[35] = "https://2003page.upwader.com/assets/clickomizer/yunicuaEXE.mp3";`

## PLEASE DONT FUCK IT UP. IF YOU'RE GONNA UPLOAD SOME FETISH ART BDSM BALLGAG BJ ART JUST QUIT THE PROJECT BRO, YOU'RE TOO HORNY

## Text above is a joke, please dont submit BDSM or any porn to the Clickomizer, since it's not allowed.

Dont even think joining RetroSite/TWTACCT if that's what you're only going to do.
